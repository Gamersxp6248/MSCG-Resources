Required files for a card to function:
"cardface_cardname.png"
"cardname-ability1.png"
"cardname-ability2.png"
"cardname-ability3.png"
Card backs are 512x1024
Card faces are 1024x1024

Use the examples, you can see that Card Faces are squashed back into 512x1024 when on long cards, and cropped in short cards.
If it's a foil card, add "-foil01", "-foil02", and "-foil03" to the end of your "cardface_cardname" files. Foil cards cannot take any more or less than 3 layers.
If your foil card doesn't have 3 layers, and you didn't add a default card face, your card WILL show up as missingno.
If you desperately need less than 3 layers, just put a blank png in.
There's no guidance for making custom tables yet.
Just because you made the resources for your card doesn't mean it quite works yet either.
